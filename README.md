# cl-false
Implementing FALSE in Common Lisp using macros [WIP]

Example program (deliberately over-complex to demonstrate major functionalities):

`{This leaves all the numbers from i (up/down) to 10 on the stack}

1 i:
[10>$$[[1-]]?\~[[1+]]?\%]f:
[$;@!\:]u:
i; [$10=~][$f;!i$@\u;!;]#`

This example doesn't work using my implementation just yet; I still need to sort out nested lambdas. It should be able to work soon, though.
