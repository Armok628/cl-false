# cl-false
Implementing FALSE in Common Lisp using macros (mostly finished)

Example program (deliberately over-complex to demonstrate major functionalities):

`{This leaves all the numbers from i (up/down) to 10 on the stack}`

`1 i:
[10>$$[[1-]]?\~[[1+]]?\%]f:
[$;@!\:]u:
[[$10=~][$f;!i$@\u;!;]#]l:
i;l;!`
